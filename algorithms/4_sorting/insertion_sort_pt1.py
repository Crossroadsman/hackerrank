Insertion Sort
==============
These challenges will cover Insertion Sort, a simple and intuitive sorting 
algorithm. We will first start with an already sorted list.

Insert element into sorted list 
-------------------------------
Given a sorted list with an unsorted number `e` in the rightmost cell, can you 
write some simple code to insert into the array so that it remains sorted?

Print the array every time a value is shifted in the array until the array is 
fully sorted. The goal of this challenge is to follow the correct order of 
insertion sort.

*Guideline*: You can copy the value of `e` to a variable and consider its cell 
"empty". Since this leaves an extra cell empty on the right, you can shift 
everything over until `e` can be inserted. This will create a duplicate of each 
value, but when you reach the right spot, you can replace it with `e`.

Input Format
------------
There will be two lines of input:
 - `size` the size of the array
 - `arr` the array containing `size - 1` sorted integers and 1 unsorted integer 
 `e` in the rightmost cell

Output Format 
-------------
On each line, output the entire array every time an item is shifted in it.

Constraints
-----------
1 <= `size` <= 1000
-10,000 <= `e` <= 10000, `e` âˆˆ `arr`

Sample Input
------------

5
2 4 6 8 3

Sample Output
-------------

2 4 6 8 8 
2 4 6 6 8 
2 4 4 6 8 
2 3 4 6 8 

Explanation
-----------

3 is removed from the end of the array.
In the 1st line 8 > 3, so  8 is shifted one cell to the right. 
In the 2nd line 6 > 3, so  6 is shifted one cell to the right. 
In the 3rd line 4 > 3, so  4 is shifted one cell to the right. 
In the 4th line 2 < 3, so  3 is placed at position .

Task
----

Complete the method insertionSort which takes in one parameter:

- `arr` an array with the value `e` in the right-most cell.
